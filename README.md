# Road Accident Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project analyzes road accident data to identify trends, contributing factors, and key insights. The data includes accident details such as location, severity, weather conditions, and vehicle types. The analysis was conducted using Excel, incorporating pivot tables, charts, and a comprehensive dashboard.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of multiple attributes related to road accidents, including:

- `Accident_Index`
- `Accident_Date`, `Month`, `Year`, `Day_of_Week`
- `Junction_Control`, `Junction_Detail`
- `Accident_Severity`
- `Latitude`, `Longitude`
- `Light_Conditions`
- `Local_Authority_(District)`
- `Carriageway_Hazards`
- `Number_of_Casualties`, `Number_of_Vehicles`
- `Police_Force`
- `Road_Surface_Conditions`, `Road_Type`
- `Speed_Limit`
- `Time`
- `Urban_or_Rural_Area`
- `Weather_Conditions`
- `Vehicle_Type`

## Analysis Performed
